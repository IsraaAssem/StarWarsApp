# StarWarsApp
A simple Star Wars information app using Swift and UIKit that integrates with the Star Wars API (SWAPI). 
The application allows users to view a list of Star Wars characters and starships. 
- Use UIKit to create the user interface.
- The main screen has two tabs: one for a list of Star Wars characters and another for a list of Star Wars starships.
- Each tab should has a list of items fetched from the API.
- Each character should display their name, a button to add it to favorites and an option to view more details.
- Each starship should display its name, a button to add it to favorites and an option to view more details.
- Implement a detail view that shows more information about a selected character (e.g., height, mass, hair color, skin color, eye color, birth year, gender).
- Implement a detail view that shows more information about a selected starship (e.g., model, manufacturer, cost in credits, length, crew, passengers).
- Use Alamofire for network requests to fetch data from the API.
- Use Auto Layout to ensure the UI works on different screen sizes.
- Implement the ability to search for characters and starships by name.
- Implement pagination to load more characters and starships as the user scrolls.
